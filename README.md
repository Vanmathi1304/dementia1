## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Step 1: Clone or Download
Ensure all files are in your project directory:
```
dementia/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── model.h5 (your pretrained model)
├── utils/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── preprocessing.py
│   ├── model_loader.py
│   ├── gradcam.py
│   └── report_generator.py
└── README.md
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Add Your Model
Place your pretrained model file (`model.h5`) in the root directory of the project.

**Note:** If `model.h5` is not found, the application will use a dummy model for demonstration purposes. For actual predictions, ensure your model file is present.

### Step 4: (Optional) Configure OpenAI API
For enhanced AI-generated reports, set your OpenAI API key:
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Windows CMD
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Linux/Mac
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

If no API key is provided, the system will use template-based reports.

   - Image will be displayed automatically

4. **Analyze**:
   - Click "🔍 Analyze MRI Scan" button
   - Wait for processing (image preprocessing, model prediction, Grad-CAM generation)

5. **View Results**:
   - See predicted class with color-coded indicator

7. **Logout**: Click "Logout" button when finished

## Model Requirements

Your `model.h5` file should:
- Be a Keras/TensorFlow model
- Accept input shape: `(None, 224, 224, 3)`
- Output 4 classes (or be adaptable to 4 classes)
- Use softmax activation for the output layer

### Expected Output Classes:
- Class 0: NonDemented
- Class 1: VeryMildDemented
- Class 2: MildDemented
- Class 3: ModerateDemented

## Technical Details

### Image Preprocessing
- **Resize**: All images are resized to 224×224 pixels using LANCZOS resampling
- **Normalization**: Pixel values normalized to [0, 1] range
- **Format**: Images converted to RGB if needed
- **Dimensions**: Expanded to (1, 224, 224, 3) for model input

### Grad-CAM Implementation
- Automatically detects the last convolutional layer
- Computes gradient-weighted class activation maps
- Overlays heatmap with configurable transparency (default: 40%)
- Uses JET colormap for visualization

### Report Generation
- **Template-based**: Always available, generates professional medical reports
- **AI-enhanced**: Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo when API key is available
- **PDF Generation**: Uses ReportLab library for PDF creation with embedded images

## Troubleshooting

### Model Not Found
- Ensure `model.h5` is in the root directory
- Check file permissions
- The app will use a dummy model for demonstration if model is missing

### Import Errors
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version (3.8+ required)

### Grad-CAM Not Working
- Ensure your model has convolutional layers
- Check that the model architecture is compatible
- The app will fall back to original image if Grad-CAM fails

### PDF Generation Issues
- Ensure `reportlab` is installed: `pip install reportlab`
- Check that images are in valid format

### OpenAI API Issues
- Verify API key is set correctly
- Check internet connection
- App will fall back to template-based reports if API fails

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important Security Considerations:**

1. **Hardcoded Credentials**: The current implementation uses hardcoded credentials for demonstration. For production use:
   - Implement proper authentication (OAuth, JWT, etc.)
   - Use environment variables or secure credential storage
   - Implement password hashing

2. **Model Security**: Ensure your model file is from a trusted source

3. **Data Privacy**: Patient data is stored in session state only. For production:
   - Implement proper database storage
   - Ensure HIPAA compliance
   - Implement data encryption

4. **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
